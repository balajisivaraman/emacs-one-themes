# One for Emacs

One for Emacs is an Emacs port of the [One theme for
Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one/). It provides both the
Dark and Light variants. (Note that the Vim theme itself was a port of
[One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) and [One
Light](https://atom.io/themes/one-light-syntax) syntax themes for the
Atom editor.)

One for Emacs is tested only under Emacs 24 or greater, but should be
working under Emacs 23 as well. The theme is implemented in terms of
customizations and `deftheme` and does not require the
`color-theme-package`.
